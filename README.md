# Face Detection and Recognition using OpenCV

## Face_detect.py
This code detects the whole body along with its faces and draws rectangular boxes around it.
### To run this code:
                  * Download Face_detect.py, haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml,haarcascade_fullbody.xml,haarcascade_eye.xml and pic5.jpg
                  * You can replace pic5.jpg with any picture you want to test.
                 
                
## Face_rec.py
This code uses a Machine learning module to recognize faces. The faces folder contains all the images that you would like to recognize and test.jpg contains the image that you would like to test to see if it matches any of the faces in the faces folder. If a face is found it draws a rectangular box around it and creates a label with the name of the face, if it's not recognized it displays "Unknown Face".
### To run this code:
                  * Download Face_rec.py, faces, test.jpg 
                  * You can add faces to the folder and replace test.jpg with any picture you want to test.
